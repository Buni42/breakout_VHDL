# breakout_VHDL
A breakout game written in VHDL for the Nexys4 DDR FPGA board.
For now it's just a basic pong style game with one player. 
The speed of the ball gradually increases througout the game, when ball collides with player, you gain points. 
There is also a powerup system based on the score.

TO DO's : 
  - add a death-cycle with a death scene and restart button.
  - add breakables and gain points from breaking them instead of relying on ball collision with player.
  - add more powerups: bigger ball, bigger player, more balls, etc.
